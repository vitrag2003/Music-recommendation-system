  <h1>Spotify Music Recommendation System</h1>

  <p>Welcome to our Spotify Music Recommendation System repository! ðŸŽ¶âœ¨</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Our project is an exploration into the world of music recommendation, leveraging the power of machine learning and deep learning techniques alongside the rich Spotify API. Unlike conventional recommendation systems, our approach goes beyond suggesting music solely based on artists. We take into account the nuances of the music landscape, considering factors such as the decade, song popularity, and most importantly, genre.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Artist-Centric Recommendations:</strong> Discover new artists similar to your favorites.</li>
    <li><strong>Decade-Specific Suggestions:</strong> Travel through time with recommendations tailored to specific decades.</li>
    <li><strong>Popularity Metrics:</strong> Find music that resonates with the crowd by exploring popular songs.</li>
    <li><strong>Genre-Driven Recommendations:</strong> Immerse yourself in diverse musical genres with our personalized suggestions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> We harness the power of ML algorithms to analyze patterns and provide accurate recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Our system utilizes deep learning techniques to understand intricate relationships within the music data.</li>
    <li><strong>Spotify API Integration:</strong> Seamless integration with the Spotify API allows us to access a vast music library.</li>
  </ul>
